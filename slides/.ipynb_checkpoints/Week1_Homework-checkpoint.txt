# Assignment: Finish Exercise 5, 7 and 9 after Chapter 1

#            Exercise 5: What is wrong with the following code:
#            >>> primt 'Hello world!'
#            File "<stdin>", line 1
#            primt 'Hello world!'
#            ^
#            SyntaxError: invalid syntax

# Answer: syntax error -> `print('Hello World')` should be the correct language for Python to recognize it (primt should be print).


#            Exercise 7: What will the following program print out:
#            x = 43
#            x = x + 1
#            print(x)
#            a) 43
#            b) 44
#            c) x + 1
#            d) Error because x = x + 1 is not possible mathematically

# Answer: B => 44, because the variable x = 43 is redefined by x = x+1, so that x = (43+1) = 44


#           Exercise 9: How do you fix a “Syntax Error”?

# Answer:  Python doesn't recognize the code/syntax that you are using. 
#          Read the error code and the line where the Python language was wrongly used.
#          You need to check for spelling/grammatical errors in the line provided in the error code, such as: spaces, brackets, parantheses, wrongly spelled preserved words or the lack of the   
#          former mentioned options.
#          Correct your mistake and run the code again.
#          If the error persists after re-running the code, try to trace your steps back from the point the error is shown and see if the unrecognized syntax appears earlier in your script and 
#          repeat these steps untill the syntax error is fixed.
